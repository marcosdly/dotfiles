# dotfiles

Here you will find every configuration file I need on my systems. The general files and paths consider an Arch Linux installation, so if you are running Arch Linux you can just copy and paste the files without a problem. If you are running other distros I can't guarantee that the paths would work since I never spend more than some weeks in other distros before sticking with Arch Linux.

Besides that, eventually I will be using other distros like Debian just for the sake of experience, and when it happens, I will update this README and add another one with the package names specifically for that distro. Until this, you can check the package names for Arch Linux in the `ARCH.md`.
